(Lindsay Dyjach) A long long time ago lived an old women called Prushka. She had a hut in the middle of a dense, creepy forest, and an excessive amount of candlelight. She was a humble women, and a lonely women. Each day her lonliness grew and grew, slowly filling up her heart. As her lonliness grew, she became paranoid about the world around her. The forest seemed like the dark unkown, and her hut had stopped being her home. After years and years, there was a knock at her door. A sharp, menacing, knock.

(Connor Dyjach) Prushka stopped dead in her tracks. the THUMP THUMP THUMP of her heart was the only audible noise. Again, there was a knock at her door, except this time it was 
even louder and more menacing. With five quick but silent steps she reached the door. She grabs the doorknob and begins twisting slowly. She then cracks the door ever so slightly so the candlelight made its way ever so slightly onto the person...or thing that was at the door.

(Tim. Eric Doughery) Though the light fell onto the shape at the door, it illuminated nothing. It was like solid darkness staring back at her, and it was shaped like nightmare. The thing stepped forward, and she stumbled back. "What...What are you?" If it had a face, it would have grimaced at the question. Prushka felt her heart thump like thunder as she looked for a way out. There was none, the thing was blocking the door. Did it seem larger? Prushka nearly tripped as her feet met the wall. If it had breath, she would felt it on her face. "A-Answer my question." 
"Did you really forget the fear you cast into the darkness, your patterns into the void?"
"What?" Prushka stared in confusion at the creature.
"This place is suffering. Unmake us. Unmake your fear."
"I-I can't. I don't think I can do that."
It raised a gnarled and withered hand, "I know."
